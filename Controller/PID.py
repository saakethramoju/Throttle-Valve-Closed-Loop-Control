class PID:
    """
    Discrete PID controller with output saturation, optional output slew-rate
    limiting, simple anti-windup, and filtered derivative-on-measurement.

    This controller is intended for sampled-time control of a scalar signal:

        error = target - measurement

    The nominal control law is:

        u_unsat = u_bias + Kp * error + Ki * integral - Kd * d(measurement)/dt

    where the derivative is taken on the measurement instead of the error.
    This avoids derivative kick when the target changes suddenly. The raw
    measurement derivative is low-pass filtered before use in the control law
    to reduce sensitivity to numerical noise, sensor noise, and small plant
    oscillations.

    After the nominal control output is formed, the controller applies:
    1. output saturation between u_min and u_max
    2. optional output slew-rate limiting, if du_dt_limit is provided

    The slew-rate limiter constrains how quickly the final controller output can
    change from one update to the next:

        |u[k] - u[k-1]| / dt <= du_dt_limit

    This is useful when the commanded variable should move more gradually, such
    as a throttle-like correction signal.

    Features
    --------
    - Proportional, integral, and derivative control
    - Derivative on measurement
    - First-order low-pass filtering of the derivative estimate
    - Output saturation between u_min and u_max
    - Optional output slew-rate limiting via du_dt_limit
    - Simple anti-windup by freezing the integral when saturated and the error
      would push the controller farther into saturation
    - Optional constant bias term u_bias

    Parameters
    ----------
    Kp : float
        Proportional gain.
    Ki : float
        Integral gain.
    Kd : float
        Derivative gain. This multiplies the filtered derivative of the
        measurement.
    u_min : float
        Minimum allowable controller output.
    u_max : float
        Maximum allowable controller output.
    u_bias : float, optional
        Constant bias added to the controller output. Default is 0.0.
    tau_d : float, optional
        Time constant for the first-order low-pass filter applied to the raw
        measurement derivative. Larger values give more smoothing but reduce
        derivative responsiveness. Must be nonnegative. Default is 0.05.
    du_dt_limit : float or None, optional
        Maximum allowed rate of change of the final controller output, in
        output-units per second. If None, no slew-rate limiting is applied.
        Must be positive if provided. Default is None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Kp, Ki, Kd : float
        Controller gains.
    u_min, u_max : float
        Output saturation limits.
    u_bias : float
        Constant bias term.
    tau_d : float
        Derivative filter time constant.
    du_dt_limit : float or None
        Output slew-rate limit in output-units per second.
    error : float or None
        Most recent control error, target - measurement.
    integral : float
        Current integral state.
    derivative : float
        Most recent filtered derivative estimate of d(measurement)/dt.
    prev_measurement : float or None
        Previous measurement sample, used to compute the raw derivative.
    prev_u : float or None
        Previous final controller output, used for slew-rate limiting.
    u_unsat : float or None
        Most recent controller output before saturation.
    u_sat : float or None
        Most recent controller output after saturation but before slew-rate limiting.
    u : float or None
        Most recent final controller output after all limiting.

    Notes
    -----
    The derivative term is applied as:

        -Kd * derivative

    because increasing measurement implies the process variable is already
    moving upward, so the derivative term acts to oppose that motion.

    The anti-windup strategy used here is intentionally simple. It prevents the
    integral from growing when the controller output is saturating and the
    current error would drive it farther into the same saturation limit.

    This class assumes the helper functions `low_pass_filter(...)` and
    `saturation(...)` already exist in the surrounding codebase.
